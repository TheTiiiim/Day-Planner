# Day-Planner

This repository is my submission to UNH Coding Bootcamp's fifth homework assignment, where we were tasked to make a day planner.

At page load, jQuery creates each hour-block and fills it with any data from `localStorage`.
At the same time, DayJs determines if the hour each block represents is in the past, present, or future, and jQuery labels it so.

The buttons on the right corrospond to the `textarea` they are inline with, and save the contents of that `textarea` in `localStorage` when clocked.

The deployed project can be found [here](https://thetiiiim.github.io/Day-Planner/).
